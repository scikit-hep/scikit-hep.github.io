# Pure Python packaging

Pure Python packages with simple builds, that is, no binary extensions, then
you can use a modern build system. The one you select doesn't really matter
that much - the PyPA's Flit is a great option. In the future, scikit-build and
meson may support this sort of configuration. Most users will likely find
this simpler and the configuration can be shared between any system that follows
[PEP 621][]. These currently include [Flit][], [PDM][], [Trampolim][], and [Whey][].
[Setuptools][] might gain support in 2022, and [Poetry][] might as well.

> `MANIFEST.in`. Those are for setuptools.

> #### SDist compatibility

> Some systems produce a compatibility `setup.py` to allow use in very old
> environments, but there is not much need for this - 99% of users of pure
> Python packages will simply get the wheel - you have to ask for the SDist,
> and if you do, you are probably a package manager and know what you are
> doing. And if you are, you need to support modern style builds _now_; the
> PyPA packages are starting to drop `setup.py`'s.


## pyproject.toml: build-system

Packages must have a `pyproject.toml` file that selects the backend (this one
is for Flit):

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["flit_core >=3.2"]
build-backend = "flit_core.buildapi"
```

## pyproject.toml: project

The metadata is specified in a standards-based ([PEP 621][]) format:

```toml
[project]
name = "package"
description = "A great package."
readme = "README.md"
authors = [
  {name="My Name", email="me@email.com"},
]
maintainers = [
  {name="Scikit-HEP", email="scikit-hep-admins@googlegroups.com"},
]
license = {file="LICENSE"}
requires-python = ">=3.6"

dependencies = [
  "numpy>=1.13.3",
]

You can read more about each field, and all allowed fields, in [PEP 621][],
or [Flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyproject_toml.html#new-style-metadata), or
[Whey](https://whey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html).

## Package structure

All packages *should* have a `src` folder, with the package code residing
inside it, such as `src/<package>/`.  This may seem like extra hassle; after
all, you can type "`python`" in the main directory and avoid installing it if
you don't have a `src` folder! However, this is a bad practice, and it causes
several common bugs, such as running `pytest` and getting the local version
instead of the installed version - this obviously tends to break if you build
parts of the library or if you access package metadata.

This sadly is not part of the standard metadata in `[project]`, so it depends
on what backend you you use. Flit and PDM use automatic detection, while
trampolim and whey do not, requiring a `tool` setting.


## Versioning

You can specify the version manually (as shown in the example), but the
backends usually provide some automatic features to help you avoid this. Flit
will pull this from a file if you ask it to. PDM can be instructed to look in a
file or use git. Trampolim can be instructed to use git.


## Including/excluding files in the SDist

This it tool specific. [Flit info here](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyproject_toml.html#sdist-section).
[PDM info here](https://pdm.fming.dev/pyproject/tool-pdm/#include-and-exclude-package-files). [Whey info here](https://whey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#tconf-tool.whey.additional-files).

## Extras

It is recommended to use extras instead of or in addition to making requirement
files. These extras a) correctly interact with install requires and other
built-in tools, b) are available directly when installing via PyPI, and c) are
allowed in `requirements.txt`, `install_requires`, `pyproject.toml`, and most
other places requirements are passed.

Here is an example of a simple extras:

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
test = [
  "pytest >=6.0",
]
mpl = [
  "matplotlib >=2.0",
]
```

Self dependencies can be used by using the name of the package, such as `dev =
["package[test,examples]"]`, but this requires Pip 21.2 or newer. We recommend
providing at least `test`, `docs`, and `dev`.
