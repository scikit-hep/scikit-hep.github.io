# Simple Python packaging

For Python packages without binary extensions and fairly simple builds can use a
modern build system instead of the classic but verbose setuptools and
`setup.py`. The one you select doesn't really matter that much; they all use a
standard configuration language specified in [PEP 621][]. The PyPA's Flit is a
great option.  In the future, scikit-build and meson may support this sort of
configuration, enabling binary extension packages to benefit too. These [PEP
621][] tools currently include [Flit][], [Hatch][], [PDM][], [Trampolim][], and
[Whey][].  [Setuptools][] has experimental support, and [Poetry][] might as
well.

Binaries mostly are unsupported in existing PEP 621 tools, though better support
is coming.

> #### Classic files
>
> These systems do not use or require `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, or
> `MANIFEST.in`. Those are for setuptools.

> #### SDist compatibility
>
> Some systems produce a compatibility `setup.py` to allow use in very old
> environments, but there is not much need for this - 99% of users of pure
> Python packages will simply get the wheel - you have to ask for the SDist,
> and if you do, you are probably a package manager and know what you are
> doing. And if you are, you need to support modern style builds _now_; the
> PyPA packages are starting to drop `setup.py`'s.



## pyproject.toml: build-system

Packages must have a `pyproject.toml` file that selects the backend:

<div class="skhep-bar d-flex m-2" style="justify-content:center;">
  <button class="skhep-bar-item btn m-2 btn-purple" onclick="openTab('flit')" id='flit-btn'>Flit</button>
  <button class="skhep-bar-item btn m-2" onclick="openTab('hatch')" id='hatch-btn'>Hatch</button>
  <button class="skhep-bar-item btn m-2" onclick="openTab('pdm')" id='pdm-btn'>PDM</button>
  <button class="skhep-bar-item btn m-2" onclick="openTab('setuptools')" id='setuptools-btn'>Setuptools (experimental)</button>
</div>

<div class="skhep-tab" markdown="1" id="flit">
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["flit_core >=3.2"]
build-backend = "flit_core.buildapi"
```
</div>
<div class="skhep-tab" markdown="1" id="hatch" style="display:none;">
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling >=0.7"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```
</div>
<div class="skhep-tab" markdown="1" id="pdm" style="display:none;">
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["pdm-pep517"]
build-backend = "pdm.pep517.api"
```
</div>
<div class="skhep-tab" markdown="1" id="setuptools" style="display:none;">
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools >= 61.0"]  # EXPERIMENTAL
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```
</div>

## pyproject.toml: project

The metadata is specified in a standards-based ([PEP 621][]) format:

```toml
[project]
name = "package"
description = "A great package."
readme = "README.md"
authors = [
  { name = "My Name", email = "me@email.com" },
]
maintainers = [
  { name = "Scikit-HEP", email = "scikit-hep-admins@googlegroups.com" },
]
license = { file = "LICENSE" }
requires-python = ">=3.7"

dependencies = [
  "numpy>=1.13.3",
]

classifiers = [
  "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",
  "License :: OSI Approved :: BSD License",
  "Programming Language :: Python :: 3 :: Only",
  "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7",
  "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8",
  "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9",
  "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10",
  "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Physics",
]

[project.urls]
Homepage = "https://github.com/scikit-hep/package"
Documentation = "https://package.readthedocs.io/"
"Bug Tracker" = "https://github.com/scikit-hep/package/issues"
Discussions = "https://github.com/scikit-hep/package/discussions"
Changelog = "https://package.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html"
```

You can read more about each field, and all allowed fields, in [PEP 621][],
[Flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyproject_toml.html#new-style-metadata)
or [Whey](https://whey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html). Note that
"Homepage" is special, and replaces the old url setting.

## Package structure

All packages *should* have a `src` folder, with the package code residing
inside it, such as `src/<package>/`.  This may seem like extra hassle; after
all, you can type "`python`" in the main directory and avoid installing it if
you don't have a `src` folder! However, this is a bad practice, and it causes
several common bugs, such as running `pytest` and getting the local version
instead of the installed version - this obviously tends to break if you build
parts of the library or if you access package metadata.

This sadly is not part of the standard metadata in `[project]`, so it depends
on what backend you you use. Flit, Hatch, PDM, and (experimental) setuptools
use automatic detection, while Trampolim and whey do not, requiring a `tool`
setting.


## Versioning

You can specify the version manually (as shown in the example), but the
backends usually provide some automatic features to help you avoid this. Flit
will pull this from a file if you ask it to. PDM can be instructed to look in a
file or use git. Trampolim can be instructed to use Git.


## Including/excluding files in the SDist

This it tool specific. [Flit info here](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyproject_toml.html#sdist-section).
[PDM info here](https://pdm.fming.dev/pyproject/tool-pdm/#include-and-exclude-package-files). [Whey info here](https://whey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#tconf-tool.whey.additional-files).

## Extras

It is recommended to use extras instead of or in addition to making requirement
files. These extras a) correctly interact with install requires and other
built-in tools, b) are available directly when installing via PyPI, and c) are
allowed in `requirements.txt`, `install_requires`, `pyproject.toml`, and most
other places requirements are passed.

Here is an example of a simple extras:

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
test = [
  "pytest >=6.0",
]
mpl = [
  "matplotlib >=2.0",
]
```

Self dependencies can be used by using the name of the package, such as `dev =
["package[test,examples]"]`, but this requires Pip 21.2 or newer. We recommend
providing at least `test`, `docs`, and `dev`.
