longdescription: |
  This is a framework for building checks designed to verify that a
  repository follows guidelines. By itself, it does nothing - it requires at
  least one plugin to be installed.

  With one or more plugins, it will produce a list of results - green checkmarks
  mean this rule is followed, red xâ€™s mean the rule is not. A yellow warning sign
  means that the check was skipped because a previous required check failed. Four
  output formats are supported; `rich`, `svg`, `html`, and `json`.

  [sp-repo-review](https://pypi.org/project/sp-repo-review/) provides checks
  based on the [Scientific-Python Development
  Guide](https://learn.scientific-python.org/development/) at
  [scientific-python/cookie](https://github.com/scientific-python/cookie).
