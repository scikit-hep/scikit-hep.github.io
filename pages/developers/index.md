Developer Information
=====================

The pages here are intended for developers who are making or maintaining a package,
especially one that is part of Scikit-HEP or being proposed to become part.

New developers are encouraged to read the following guidelines starting at the
guidelines and introduction. Veteran developers should still check out introduction on the
first page, as it has a guide on recommendations for your `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
