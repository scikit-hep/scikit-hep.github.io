The pages here are intended for developers who are making or maintaining a
package and want to follow modern best practices in Python.

{: .note }

If you are here to propose a new package for Scikit-HEP, please read [package
requirements][guidelines] for a list of minimum Scikit-HEP requirements for
packages joining the organization. We also have [badge recommendations][badges]
for your README, including the Scikit-HEP badge!

{: .highlight }

The developer pages have been moved to [Scientific-Python][]! The remaining
pages here will redirect to the new site.

New developers can start with an [introductory tutorial][intro] before moving
on to the guide.

Following that, there are recommendations for [style][], intended to promote
good practices and to ensure continuity across the packages. There is a
[dedicated page for static type checking with MyPy][mypy]. There is then a guide on
[simple packaging][] or [compiled][] / [classic][] packaging, which should help
in ensuring a consistent developer and user experience when working with distribution.

A section on CI follows, with a [general setup guide][gha_basic], and then two
choices for using CI to distribute your package, on for [pure
Python][gha_pure], and one for [compiled extensions][gha_wheels]. You can read
about setting up good tests on the [pytest page][pytest], including
[coverage][], and [docs][]. You can also see how to set up a [task runner][] to
simplify tasks and help new contributors.

{: .highlight-title }

> New project template
>
> Once you have completed the guidelines, there is a
> [copier][]/[cookiecutter][]/[cruft][] project, [scientific-python/cookie][],
> that implements these guidelines and lets you setup a new package from a
> template in less than 60 seconds! Twelve build backends including compiled
> backends, generation tested in Nox, and kept in-sync with the guide.

{: .important-title }

> Checking an existing project
>
> We provide [sp-repo-review][], a set of [repo-review][] checks for comparing
> your repository with the guidelines, runnable right in the guide via
> WebAssembly! All checks point to a linked badge in the guide.
