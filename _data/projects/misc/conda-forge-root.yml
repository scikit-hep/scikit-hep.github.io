    CERN's [ROOT][] framework traditionally has been difficult to install --
    several hours on a single core, with many dependencies.  The situation is
    better than it used to be, it is easier to build and available in more
    places, but Python was still a challenge; ROOT is linked to just one
    version of Python, and the one you get with pre-built ROOT can often be the
    wrong one.  And, if you use the [Anaconda Python distribution][Anaconda],
    which is a popular choice for Scikit-HEP users, the official ROOT team
    recommendation for building it on top of the Anaconda stack was: too hard,
    don't do it.  But now, the ROOT [Conda-Forge][] package provides a fully
    featured ROOT binary package for macOS or Linux, Python 2.7 and 3.6--3.8,
    fully integrated into the Conda environment system!

    The Conda-Forge ROOT project has been developed by Scikit-HEP admins and is
    used in the Continuous Integration (CI) system of several of our packages
    to ensure consistency and interoperability with ROOT. It is used or
    intended to be used in our ROOT-based packages, like `root_numpy`. Analysts
    can create an environment with ROOT by the following trivial
    `environment.yml` file, often used to create tutorials on [binder][]:

    ```yml
    name: uproot_and_root
    channels:
      - conda-forge
      - pytorch
    dependencies:
      - root    # Conda-Forge ROOT
      - uproot  # Can be mixed with other Scikit-HEP packages
    ```
