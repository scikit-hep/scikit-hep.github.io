We appreciate if you consider to acknowledge the Scikit-HEP project in case it has made, or is having, an impact on your work or research.
We suggest the following citation for the project as a whole (in BibTeX format):

```BibTeX
@article{Rodrigues:2020syo,
    author = "Rodrigues, Eduardo and others",
    editor = "Doglioni, C. and Kim, D. and Stewart, G. A. and Silvestris, L. and Jackson, P. and Kamleh, W.",
    title = "{The Scikit HEP Project -- overview and prospects}",
    eprint = "2007.03577",
    archivePrefix = "arXiv",
    primaryClass = "physics.comp-ph",
    doi = "10.1051/epjconf/202024506028",
    journal = "EPJ Web Conf.",
    volume = "245",
    pages = "06028",
    year = "2020"
}
```

Kindly consider citing any specific package if that seems appropriate.
Most package GitHub repositories contain at the very least a Zenodo badge,
and many exhibit a _Cite this repository_ item in the menu, defined via a `CITATION.cff` citation file.
Some may also have a citation page, as for example <https://github.com/scikit-hep/iminuit/blob/develop/CITATION.rst>.
