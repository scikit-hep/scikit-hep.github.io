FAQ
===

What is the exact project name?
-------------------------------

The project is called Scikit-HEP, where HEP stands for High Energy Physics
(often alternatively named as Particle Physics).
Notice the upper-case \"S\" and \"HEP\".
The project name is distinct from the project Python (meta)package `scikit-hep`.

The name took inspiration from the several \"scikits\" - scientific toolboxes built around SciPy.

How to pronounce the project name?
----------------------------------

Like \"sy-kit happ\"(y), forgetting about the \"y\" in \"happy\".
Of course \"sci\" stands for science.

How to get started contributing?
--------------------------------

You are most welcome and encouraged to get in touch via the resources
listed at [Getting in touch](getting-in-touch).
Please also refer to each package repository and browse through the list
of \"issues\" or files CONTRIBUTING for details on how to get involved.

Is there support for PyPy?
--------------------------

It\'s a nice idea. Support for [PyPy](http://pypy.org/) across the various
packages could be envisaged in the near future but only once the scientific
stack based on [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) supports it. This being
said, certain packages do support PyPy already.

Is there support for GPUs?
--------------------------

Support for GPU-oriented code is not foreseen as default but some of the
packages do provide support, and others envisage it in the near- or medium-term future.
Please refer to the documentation of the various packages.
