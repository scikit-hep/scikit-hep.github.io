## Gitter

The fastest way to contact us is via the Gitter channel
[Scikit-HEP/community][], ideal for
informal exchanges. The organisation provides the following topical Gitter channels,
with some channels of broad interest hosted under the
[HEP Software Foundation](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) (HSF):

- [`awkward-array`](https://gitter.im/Scikit-HEP/awkward-array)
- [On histogramming](https://gitter.im/HSF/PyHEP-histogramming)
- [`iminuit`](https://gitter.im/Scikit-HEP/iminuit)
- [`uproot`](https://gitter.im/Scikit-HEP/uproot)
- [`zfit`](https://gitter.im/zfit/zfit)

It is worth to mention the related rooms [HSF/PyHEP][] and [HSF/PyHEP-newcomers][] from the HSF,
which are of particular interest for general exchanges with the "Python in HEP" community.
