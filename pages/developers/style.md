## Pre-commit

Scikit-HEP uses [pre-commit][] to check code style. It can be installed through
`brew` (macOS) or `pip` (anywhere). There are two modes to use it locally; you
can check manually with `pre-commit run` (changes only) or `pre-commit run --all-files` (all). You can also run `pre-commit install` to add checks as a
git pre-commit hook (which is where it gets its name). It's worth trying, even
if you've tried and failed to set up a custom pre-commit hook before; it's quite
elegant and does not add or commit the changes, it just makes the changes and
allows you to check and add them. You can always override the hook with `-n`.

[pre-commit]: https://pre-commit.com

Here is a minimal `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file with some handy options:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: "v4.3.0"
    hooks:
      - id: check-added-large-files
      - id: check-case-conflict
      - id: check-merge-conflict
      - id: check-symlinks
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: debug-statements
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: mixed-line-ending
      - id: name-tests-test
        args: ["--pytest-test-first"]
      - id: requirements-txt-fixer
      - id: trailing-whitespace
```

**Helpful tip**: Pre-commit runs top-to-bottom, so put checks that modify content
(like the several of the pre-commit-hooks above, or Black) above
checks that might be more likely to pass after the modification (like flake8).

**Keeping pinned versions fresh**: You can use `pre-commit autoupdate` to move your
tagged versions forward to the latest tags! Due to the design of pre-commit's
caching system, these _must_ point at fixed tags, never put a branch here.

**Checking in CI**: You can have this checked and often automatically corrected
for you using [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci). It will even
update your `rev:` versions every week or so if your checks update!

To use, just go to [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci), click
"Log in with GitHub", click "Add an Installation" if adding for the first time
for an org or user, or "Manage repos on GitHub" for an existing installation
(like Scikit-HEP), then add your repository from the list in GitHub's interface.

Now there will be a new check, and pre-commit.ci will commit changes if the
pre-commit check made any changes. Note that there are a couple of missing features:
Docker based checks will not work (pre-commit.ci already runs in docker), you
cannot enable a `--manual` flag, so extra checks will not run, and jobs should not
download packages (use `additional-dependencies:` to add what you need).

## Black

[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a popular auto-formatter
from the Python Software Foundation. One of the main features of Black is that
it is "opinionated"; that is, it is almost completely unconfigurable. Instead of
allowing you to come up with your own format, it enforces one on you. While I
am quite sure you can come up with a better format, having a single standard
makes it possible to learn to read code very fast - you can immediately see
nested lists, matching brackets, etc. There also is a faction of developers
that dislikes all auto-formatting tools, but inside a system like pre-commit,
auto-formatters are ideal. They also speed up the writing of code because you
can ignore formatting your code when you write it. By imposing a standard,
all Scikit-HEP developers can quickly read any package's code.

Also, properly formatted code has other benefits, such as if two developers
make the same change, they get the same formatting, and merge requests are
easier. The style choices in Black were explicitly made to optimize git diffs!

There are a _few_ options, mostly to enable/disable certain files, remove
string normalization, and to change the line length, and those go in your
`pyproject.toml` file.

Here is the snippet to add Black to your `.pre-commit-config.yml`:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/psf/black
  rev: "22.6.0"
  hooks:
    - id: black
```

<details markdown="1"><summary>You can add a Black badge to your repo as well</summary>

```md
[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)
```

```rst
.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg
    :target: https://github.com/psf/black
```

</details>

In _very_ specific situations, you may want to retain special formatting. After
carefully deciding that it is a special use case, you can use `# fmt: on` and
`# fmt: off` around a code block to have it keep custom formatting. _Always_
consider refactoring before you try this option! Most of the time, you can find
a way to make the Blacked code look better by rewriting your code; factor out
long unreadable portions into a variable, avoid writing matrices as 1D lists,
etc.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Jupyter notebook support</summary>

If you want Black for Jupyter notebooks _too_, replace `id: black` with `id:black-jupyter` above.
You also might like the following hook, which cleans Jupyter outputs:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout
  rev: "0.6.0"
  hooks:
    - id: nbstripout
```

</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Documentation / README snippets support</summary>

If you want Black used in your documentation, you can use blacken-docs. This
can even catch syntax errors in code snippets! It supports markdown and
restructured text. Note that because black is in `additional_dependencies`,
you'll have to keep it up to date manually.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/asottile/blacken-docs
  rev: v1.12.1
  hooks:
    - id: blacken-docs
      additional_dependencies: [black==22.3.0]
```

</details>

## Check-Manifest

[Check-manifest](https://pypi.org/project/check-manifest/) is a fantastic,
highly recommended tool that verifies you have working SDists. You can install
it from PyPI. Run it on your repository and see what it says. If you want to ignore
files (like test folders, example folders, docs, etc) you can add these into your
`pyproject.toml` file:

```toml
[tool.check-manifest]
ignore = [
    ".travis.yml",
]
```

Add the following to your pre-commit config:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest
  rev: "0.48"
  hooks:
    - id: check-manifest
```

If you use `setuptools_scm`, you might want to add:

```yaml
additional_dependencies: ["setuptools_scm[toml]"]
```

<details markdown="1"><summary>If this is too slow:</summary>

**Warning**: For a complex package, this may be slow. You can optionally set
`stages: [manual]` just below the id, and then only run this explicitly
(probably in CI only). In GHA, you should enable the manual stage, which will
run all checks:

```yaml
- uses: pre-commit/action@v2.0.3
  with:
    extra_args: --show-diff-on-failure --all-files --hook-stage manual
```

</details>

## Type checking

One of the most exciting advancements in Python in the last 10 years has been
static type hints. Scikit-HEP is just beginning to make sure packages are
type-hint ready. One of the challenges for providing static type hints is that
it was developed in the Python 3 era and it really shines in a Python 3.7+
codebase (due to `from __future__ import annotations`, which turns annotations
into strings and allows you to use future Python features in Python 3.7+
annotations as long as your type checker supports them). For now, it is
recommended that you make an attempt to support type checking through your
public API in the best way that you can (based on your supported Python
versions). Stub files can be used instead for out-of-line typing.
[MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is suggested for type checking,
though there are several other good options to try, as well. If you have
built-in support for type checking, you need to add empty `py.typed` files to
all packages/subpackages to indicate that you support it.

Read more about type checking on the [dedicated page][mypy page].

The MyPy addition for pre-commit:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
  rev: "v0.971"
  hooks:
    - id: mypy
      files: src
      args: []
```

You should always specify args, as the hook's default hides issues - it's
designed to avoid configuration, but you should add configuration. You can also
add items to the virtual environment setup for MyPy by pre-commit, for example:

```yaml
additional_dependencies: [attrs==21.2.0]
```

MyPy has a config section in `pyproject.toml` that looks like this:

```ini
[tool.mypy]
files = "src"
python_version = "3.7"
strict = true
show_error_codes = true
enable_error_code = ["ignore-without-code", "redundant-expr", "truthy-bool"]
warn_unreachable = true


# You can disable imports or control per-module/file settings here
[[tool.mypy.overrides]]
module = [ "numpy.*", ]
ignore_missing_imports = true
```

There are a lot of options, and you can start with only typing global code and
functions with at least one type annotation (the default) and enable more
checks as you go (possibly by slowly uncommenting items in the list above).
You can ignore missing imports on libraries as shown above, one section each.
And you can disable MyPy on a line with `# type: ignore`. One strategy would
be to enable `check_untyped_defs` first, followed by `disallow_untyped_defs`
then `disallow_incomplete_defs`. You can add these _per file_ by adding a `# mypy: <option>` at the top of a file. You can also pass `--strict` on the
command line. `strict = true` is now allowed in config files, too.

The extra strict options shown above (`warn_unreachable`, `redundant-expr`, and
`truthy-bool`) can trigger too often (like on `sys.platform` checks) and have
to be ignored occasionally, but can find some signifiant logic errors in your
typing.

## PyCln

[PyCln][] will clean up your imports if you have any that are not needed. There is
a Flake8 check for this, but it's usually nicer to automatically do the cleanup
instead of forcing a user to manually delete unneeded imports. If you use the manual
stage, it's opt-in instead of automatic.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/hadialqattan/pycln
  rev: "v2.0.4"
  hooks:
    - id: pycln
      args: [--all]
      stages: [manual]
```

## Flake8

[Flake8][] can check a collection of good practices for you, ranging from
simple style to things that might confuse or detract users, such as unused
imports, named values that are never used, mutable default arguments, and more.
Unlike black and some other tools, flake8 does not correct problems, it just
reports them. Some of the checks could have had automated fixes, sadly (which
is why Black is nice). Here is a suggested `.flake8` or `setup.cfg` to enable
compatibility with Black (flake8 does not support pyproject.toml configuration,
sadly):

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = E203, E501
```

One recommended plugin for flake8 is `flake8-bugbear`, which catches many
common bugs. It is highly opinionated and can be made more so with the `B9`
setting. You can also set a max complexity, which bugs you when you have
complex functions that should be broken up. Here is an opinionated config:

```ini
[flake8]
max-complexity = 12
extend-select = B9
extend-ignore = E203, E501, E722, B950
```

(Error E722 is important, but it is identical to the activated B001.) Here is the flake8 addition for pre-commit, with the `bugbear` plugin:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
  rev: "4.0.1"
  hooks:
    - id: flake8
      additional_dependencies: [flake8-bugbear]
```

This _will_ be too much at first, so you can disable or enable any test by it's
label. You can also disable a check or a list of checks inline with
`# noqa: X###` (where you list the check label(s)). Over time, you can fix
and enable more checks. A few interesting plugins:

- [`flake8-bugbear`](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-bugbear/): Fantastic checker that catches common situations that tend to create bugs. Codes: `B`, `B9`
- [`flake8-docstrings`](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-docstrings/): Docstring checker. `--docstring-convention=pep257` is default, `numpy` and `google` also allowed.
- [`flake8-spellcheck`](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-spellcheck/): Spelling checker. Code: `SC`
- [`flake8-import-order`](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-import-order/): Enforces PEP8 grouped imports (you may prefer isort). Code: `I`
- [`pep8-naming`](https://pypi.org/project/pep8-naming/): Enforces PEP8 naming rules. Code: `N`
- [`flake8-print`](https://pypi.org/project/pep8-naming/): Makes sure you don't have print statements that sneak in. Code: `T`

<details markdown="1"><summary>Flake8-print details:</summary>

Having something verify you don't add a print statement by mistake is _very_
useful. A common need for the print checker would be to add it to a single
directory (`src` if you are following the convention recommended). You can do
the next best thing by removing directories and file just for this check (`T`)
in your flake8 config:

```ini
[flake8]
per-file-ignores =
    tests/*: T
    examples/*: T
```

</details>

## YesQA

Over time, you can end up with extra "noqa" comments that are no longer needed. This is a flake8 helper that removes those comments when they are no longer required.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/asottile/yesqa
  rev: "v1.3.0"
  hooks:
    - id: yesqa
```

You need to have the same extra dependencies as flake8. In YAML, you can save the list given to yesqa and repeat it in flake8 using `&flake8-dependencies` and `*flake8-dependencies` after the colon.

## isort

You can have your imports sorted automatically by [isort][]. This will sort your
imports, and is black compatible. One reason to have sorted imports is to
reduce merge conflicts. Another is to clarify where imports come from -
standard library imports are in a group above third party imports, which are
above local imports. All this is configurable, as well. To use isort, the
following pre-commit config will work:

[isort]: https://pycqa.github.io/isort/

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/isort
  rev: "5.10.1"
  hooks:
    - id: isort
```

In order to use it, you need to add some configuration. You can add it to `pyproject.toml` or classic config files:

```ini
[tool.isort]
profile = "black"
```

[isort]: https://pycqa.github.io/isort/

## PyUpgrade

Another useful tool is [PyUpgrade][], which monitors your codebase for "old" style
syntax. Most useful to keep Python 2 outdated constructs out, it can even do
some code updates for different versions of Python 3, like adding f-strings
when clearly better (please always use them, they are faster) if you set
`--py36-plus` (for example). This is a recommended addition for any project.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade
  rev: "v2.37.2"
  hooks:
    - id: pyupgrade
      args: ["--py37-plus"]
```

[pyupgrade]: https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade:

> <h4 style="no_toc">Note:</h4>
>
> If you set this to `--py37-plus`, you can add the annotations import by adding
> the following line to your isort pre-commit hook configuration:
>
> ```yaml
> args: ["-a", "from __future__ import annotations"]
> ```
>
> Also make sure isort comes before pyupgrade. Now when you run pre-commit, it will
> clean up your annotations to 3.7+ style, too!

## Setup.cfg format (setuptools only)

There is a tool that keeps your `setup.cfg` organized, and makes sure that
important parts (like Python classifiers) are in sync. This tool,
`setup-cfg-fmt`, has native support for pre-commit:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/asottile/setup-cfg-fmt
  rev: "v1.20.2"
  hooks:
    - id: setup-cfg-fmt
```

Make sure you support Python 3.10! Otherwise, add `args: [--max-py-version=3.9]`
or whatever your maximum is.

## Spelling

You can and should check for spelling errors in your code too. If you want to
add this, you can use [codespell][] for common spelling mistakes. Unlike most
spell checkers, this has a list of mistakes it looks for, rather than a list of
"valid" words. To use:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell
  rev: "v2.1.0"
  hooks:
    - id: codespell
      args: ["-L", "sur,nd"]
```

You can list allowed spellings in a comma separated string passed to `-L` (or
`--ignore-words-list` - usually it is better to use long options when you are
not typing things live). The example above will allow "Big Sur" and "ND". You can instead
use a comma separated list in `setup.cfg` or `.codespellrc`:

```ini
[codespell]
ignore-words-list = sur,nd
```

You can also use a local pygrep check to eliminate common capitalization
errors, such as the one below:

```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: disallow-caps
      name: Disallow improper capitalization
      language: pygrep
      entry: PyBind|Numpy|Cmake|CCache|Github|PyTest
      exclude: .pre-commit-config.yaml
```

## PyGrep hooks

This is a repository with a [collection of pre-commit extra hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pygrep-hooks) that protect against some common, easy to detect, mistakes. You can pick and choose the hooks you want from the repo; here are some common ones:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pygrep-hooks
  rev: "v1.9.0"
  hooks:
    - id: python-check-blanket-noqa
    - id: python-check-blanket-type-ignore
    - id: python-no-log-warn
    - id: python-no-eval
    - id: python-use-type-annotations
    - id: rst-backticks
    - id: rst-directive-colons
    - id: rst-inline-touching-normal
```

If you want to add specific type ignores, see [mypy_clean_slate](https://github.com/geo7/mypy_clean_slate) for a tool that will add the specific ignores for you. You'll need to remove the existing type ignores (`git ls-files '*.py' | xargs sed -i '' 's/ # type: ignore//g'`), copy the pre-commit output (with `--show-error-codes` in mypy's args) to a file called `mypy_error_report.txt`, then run `pipx run mypy_clean_slate -a`.

[codespell]: https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell

## Clang-format (C++ only)

If you have C++ code, you should have a `.clang-format` file and use the
following pre-commit config:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-clang-format
  rev: "v14.0.6"
  hooks:
    - id: clang-format
      types_or: [c++, c, cuda]
```

This will use 1-2 MB binary wheels from PyPI on all common platforms. You can
generated such a file using `pipx run clang-format -style=llvm -dump-config > .clang-format`.

## Shellcheck (shell scripts only)

If you have shell scripts, you can protect against common mistakes using [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck).

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/shellcheck-py/shellcheck-py
  rev: "v0.8.0.4"
  hooks:
    - id: shellcheck
```

## Prettier

The [prettier](https://prettier.io) tool can format a large number of different
file types. An example of usage:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-prettier
  rev: "v2.7.1"
  hooks:
    - id: prettier
      types_or: [yaml, markdown, html, css, scss, javascript, json]
```

Since this formats a variety of very common file types (like `.html`, `.md`,
`.yaml`, `.js`, and `.json`), you will usually want to provide a `types_or` setting
(shown above) with the files you are interested in auto-formatting. You can try
it without the `types_or` first to see what it can do. Special markups in
html/markdown files might clash with auto-formatting - check to verify your
files are supported. This check runs using node, but pre-commit handles this
for you.

If you have a .editor-config file, prettier will respect the rules in it. You
can also specify [a config file](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html)
for prettier, or pass options to `args:` in pre-commit. One such option is [`--prose-wrap`](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#prose-wrap),
which can be set to `"never"` or `"always"` to have prettier reflow text. You can
turn off prettier for blocks with [comments depending on language](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html).

## PyLint (noisy)

PyLint is very opinionated, with a high signal-to-noise ratio. However, by
limiting the default checks or by starting off a new project using them, you
can get some very nice linting, including catching some problematic code that
otherwise is hard to catch. PyLint is generally not a good candidate for
pre-commit, since it needs to have your package installed - it is less static
of check than Flake8. Here is a suggested pyproject.toml entry to get
you started:

```toml
[tool.pylint]
master.py-version = "3.7"
master.jobs = "0"
reports.output-format = "colorized"
similarities.ignore-imports = "yes"
messages_control.enable = ["useless-suppression"]
messages_control.disable = [
  "design",
  "fixme",
  "line-too-long",
  "wrong-import-position",
]
```

And a noxfile entry:

```python
@nox.session
def pylint(session: nox.Session) -> None:
    session.install("-e", ".")
    session.install("pylint")
    session.run("pylint", "src", *session.posargs)
```

And you can add this to your GitHub Actions using `run: pipx run nox -s pylint`.
