In the following, projects that work closely together with Scikit-HEP are described. They extend the Python ecosystem in HEP and remain, due to their size and scope, generally independent of Scikit-HEP. In most cases, at least one Scikit-HEP core developer is on the maintainer team or regularly contributes to these packages. These packages are highly recommended for Scikit-HEP developers and users.
